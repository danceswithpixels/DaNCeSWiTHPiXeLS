<h1 style="text-align:center">Thomas Was Alone (Review)</h1>

If I could describe Thomas Was Alone in one word, it'd be "ingenious." Everything from its visuals to its gameplay screams simplicity, but strung together, they form a masterpiece. But before I start gushing over this wondrous title, allow me to provide a little background. Thomas Was Alone (hereafter simply called "Thomas") was single-handedly developed and published by Mike Bithell. On the surface, it appears to be nothing more than your typical platformer, tasking the player with moving some character(s) from one location to another. Witnessing such a simple concept blossom into a work of art is something that can only be experienced by actually playing the game. And while mere words are not enough to convey its artistic merit, I will still try my best.

Thomas doesn't try to be something it is not. There are no cinematic cutscenes, no fancy special effects, and no intricate artwork. It offers only the bare necessities it needs to tell its story. Playable characters are nothing more than squares distinguished by varying sizes and colors, but the surprise here is just how much depth these blocks of pixels have. Each square is characterized by their own personal concerns, be it their fear of loneliness or their constant need for attention. You'll find yourself growing emotionally attached to these two-dimensional blocks upon realizing how accurate they are as reflections of the internal turmoil regular people, like you and me, face daily. Fortunately, Thomas doesn't drown its players with feelings of pessimism and hopelessness. Quite the opposite, Bithell uses his characters to show how much they rely on each other in order to thrive. At the end of the day, this here is a tale of triumph over adversity through courage and teamwork.
<br><br>
However, Thomas' minimalism isn't its crowning achievement, but its unforgettable narration and soundtrack. British humorist Danny Wallace lends his rich and soothing voice to the opening of each level, commenting on the protagonists' mental state and their current predicament. It is a brilliant mechanism to drive the plot forward without interfering with the flow of gameplay. But the cherry on top that ties the whole emotional package together is the music composed with 8-bit sounds layered upon a melodic piano track. It is one of the few soundtracks to have ever tugged on my heartstrings and that, my friends, is a feat worth mentioning.
<br><br>
Ironically, it is Thomas' strongest quality that also holds it back from being the "perfect" game. The levels, of which there are about a hundred, are not at all challenging and many players should be able to breeze through the entire game in three hours or so. The narrative also takes a dive in quality around the halfway mark, when an entirely new cast of squares is introduced. The poor characterization of these new protagonists may have been forgivable had we been given the opportunity to revisit the lovable blocks we fell in love with in the first half of the game, but alas, they are quietly swept under the rug. But above all, it was a single technical problem that tainted the experience for me. As players are given access to more and more characters, navigating between them became more and more unwieldy. Instead of mapping each of them to a number key, the player must select his desired character by first parsing through the preceding ones. This cumbersome approach can be time consuming, particularly when half a dozen or more blocks are at your command.
<br><br>
Without the financial support of a big company, independent developers have always been ones forced to innovate, finding shortcuts that are beneficial to them without detracting from the quality of their work. What Bithell has done here is nothing short of brilliant, taking numerous familiar elements and packaging them into what I can only describe as a work of art. In an era where we are surrounded by big budget games that rival the quality of most action-packed movies, it feels nice to just sit back once in a while and enjoy something reminiscent of simpler times.

Grade: 4/5
