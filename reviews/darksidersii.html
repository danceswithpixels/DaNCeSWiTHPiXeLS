<h1 style="text-align:center">Darksiders II (Review)</h1>

The first Darksiders, developed by the now defunct Vigil Games, was a decent but unremarkable game. Time and time again, I have heard it heralded as an edgy reincarnation of Zelda with a pinch of God of War: a combination of exploration, puzzle-solving, and hack-and-slash combat. Nonetheless, it left a positive impression on me and I strongly believed that Darksiders II would be a must-have. Was I wrong?

Those who have not played the "prequel" should consider doing so, although it is not necessary. I say this because the timelines in both games actually run parallel to each other. In Darksiders, the player controls one of the Four Horsemen, War, who is framed for prematurely unleashing the apocalypse unto Earth. Darksiders II is told in the perspective of War's brother, Death, as he journeys through heaven and hell to exonerate his kin by reviving mankind.
<br><br>
Barring the story's poor execution (more on that later), there is a lot of good to be found in this game. Each and every element fits together seamlessly, from its music and art direction to its impressive-I dare say, even perfect-gameplay. Despite the grim predicament our hero finds himself in, Vigil manages to keep things lighthearted with witty dialogue, a droll supporting cast, and a majestic soundtrack that compliments your every action.
<br><br>
The core gameplay consists of two components. You have your run-of-the-mill hack-and-slash battles, and then you have puzzles. As with many games that incorporate the former, Darksiders II fails to encourage players to diversify their combos. If you are anything like me, you will just spam the same overpowered combo for the majority of the game out of sheer convenience. However, that is not to say that combat isn't rewarding. Darksiders II is not just visually stunning in its landscapes, but also in the fluidity of Death's motions. The animated executions are a sight to behold, and when taking down a boss many times larger than you, it genuinely feels gratifying.
<br><br>
On the other side of the coin lies the puzzles. Reflecting on my time with Darksiders II, I can confidently say that without them, the game would not even be half as good. They not only force the player to think, but also serve to reinforce pacing. These puzzles are neither too simple nor too challenging; they are exactly difficult enough to engage the player while providing him with a moment to relax and enjoy the scenery after each and every visceral confrontation.
<br><br>
A slew of other improvements from the original Darksiders is worth mentioning. First is the new leveling system. Unlike War, Death can now earn experience by killing enemies and finishing quests. Leveling up unlocks skills from one of two distinct combat trees: powered attacks or minion summoning. Also unlike War, Death's wardrobe has been vastly expanded. Players can mix and match different pieces of armor to create a look most appealing for Death. Lastly, Darksiders II offers a handful of side quests ranging from multistage tournaments to more boss fights, all of which, at least in my opinion, are worth investigating, if not completing.
<br><br>
But at the end of the day, what holds Darksiders II from being the "perfect" game? Its poorly executed narrative. For the entire game, Death has only one task: to reach the Well of Souls to revive mankind. To accomplish this, Death ends up running errands for 20+ hours for strangers who either will not let him pass or must be bribed for information. This not only demeans our protagonist, but it also becomes noticeably repetitive. There is minor character development, but the internal conflicts Death faces are nothing we have not already seen in dozens of other games.
<br><br>
So, did I feel like my $30 purchase was justified? Absolutely. With its amazing mechanics and tight, intuitive controls, Darksiders II, at the very least, deserves a free pass for its lackluster story. While Vigil Games is no longer with us, they can at least be proud of their final product. In the face of Death, they went out not with a whimper, but with a bang.

Grade: 5/5
