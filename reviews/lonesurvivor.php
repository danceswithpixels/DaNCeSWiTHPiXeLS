<h1 style="text-align:center">Lone Survivor (Review)</h1>

Although I have not written a review in a while, I can still vividly recall my month-long indie game spree, beginning with Devolver Digital's Hotline Miami and culminating in Superflat Games' Lone Survivor, which I will be reviewing today. Lone Survivor bills itself as a post-apocalyptic survival horror game in which the player controls an unnamed protagonist who spends his days exploring the dark hallways of his apartment complex in search of companionship amidst a "zombie" apocalypse. What distinguishes Lone Survivor from other survival horror games is twofold: everything is rendered in 2D, an aesthetic choice not typically associated with the horror genre, and it was all made by one man, Jasper Byrne. So is immersion still possible in such unconventional circumstances? Read on to find out!

The moment you launch Lone Survivor, you can easily see the amount of care Byrne has put into his game. Each pixel is carefully placed and every nuance, from the character animations to the background scenery, is extremely detailed. While some may argue that the pixelated composition of the game's monsters and objects makes visual cues all the more confusing, I personally found the art style helpful in simultaneously maintaining an aura of mystery and urging the player's own imagination to take hold. Equally as impressive is the game's soundtrack which features not only your eerie but generic horror music, but also soothing guitar riffs which supplement the more lighthearted segments of the game.
<br><br>
In addition to its survival horror roots, Lone Survivor also prides itself in being a psychological thriller-and with good reason. The plot is all sorts of crazy, and to even mention any particular event in detail would be a potential spoiler. Unfortunately, this also makes the ending a bit easier to guess as all the nonsensical happenings can only suggest so much. Maybe there is a twist waiting at the end of the journey. Maybe there isn't. Maybe the twist is that there is no twist! Lone Survivor's narrative, or at least its method of storytelling, isn't its strongest quality. However, that is not to say that its world lacks depth. Byrne did a fantastic job with the writing. None of the dialogue I came by struck me as cringe-inducing. Quite the opposite: every word uttered by the protagonist effectively fleshes out his character and conveys his feelings of hopelessness.
<br><br>
But what really matters, beneath the aesthetics and story, is the gameplay and it is with this that I have my biggest gripe. I wouldn't go as far as claiming that the mechanics behind Lone Survivor are bad, but I found them rather frustrating. There are some stealth elements present such as hiding behind curtains to avoid monsters, but there is no sense of danger once concealed and it all boils down to waiting for the creature to pass by. At some point in the game, the protagonist will acquire a firearm but the aiming mechanism hinders its usefulness. Shots can only be fired at 45 degree angles, making it difficult hit foes at their weak points until they are too close for comfort. What I did grow fond of were the survival aspect of the game, which encourages resource management and exploration, and its side quests, which help further flesh out the post-apocalyptic world our protagonist finds himself in.
<br><br>
Lone Survivor is a decent indie title that can be had for a dollar or two plus change during any video game sale. For the three plus hours of entertainment to be had, this is far from a bad deal. If the idea of a psychological thriller told with unconventional visuals appeals to you, there is no reason you shouldn't make the purchase. But I suppose if you stand adamantly against pixelated graphics, the survival horror genre, or supporting stellar developers, then there really is no convincing you, is there?

Grade: 3/5
