<h1 style="text-align:center">The Last of Us (Review)</h1>

2013 will go down in history as a milestone for gaming. This is not only due to the plethora of well-received games that were released, but this year will also be the end of an era. With next generation consoles to be released before the year's end, everyone is hoping the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will end their reign with a bang. Of the two, Sony and its subsidiary, Naughty Dogs, are first to step up to the challenge with the long awaited Last of Us. But the question remains; can the people behind the critically acclaimed Crash Bandicoot and Uncharted franchises bring their magic to a new IP? And more importantly, is this the generation-defining game that we've all been waiting for?

The events in The Last of Us unfold 20 years after the outbreak of a fungal virus that slowly mutates the infected into mindless, hostile creatures. The player follows two protagonists, the gruff and hardened Joel and the foul-mouthed teen Ellie, who are joined by fate and are tasked with trekking cross-country to help find a cure. It is a simple premise with depth primarily because of its intricate and lovable characters. So is this 13 hour journey one that is worth partaking in? You be the judge!

<h1 style="color:green;">The Good:</h1>

<span style="color:yellow;">Aesthetically and emotionally believable characters</span>: Naughty Dog's immaculate attention to detail is reflected in their ensemble of unique characters who all believably look and behave worn-out by the toll of surviving. Each individual Joel encounters in his travels deals with their post-apocalyptic lifestyle in vastly different ways, adding depth to otherwise forgettable characters. Although the supporting cast stands strong on their own, it is the wonderful protagonists that will have you emotionally invested. The internal conflicts and casual banter between Joel and Ellie will make you believe that they are much more than just pixels on a screen.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">A realistic and powerful narrative</span>: The first and last twenty minutes of The Last of Us are by far the most memorable of any game I have played. The cold opening will send players on a rollercoaster ride of mixed emotions, inducing smiles, fear, and panic all before the actual game even begins. While Naughty Dog is guilty of relying on post-apocalyptic clich√©s, their excellent cutscenes make this shortcoming easily forgivable. Detailed and realistic animations convincingly convey the characters' emotional state, making sense of and even foreshadowing the drastic decisions they make later in the game.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Level design ripe for exploration</span>: To better focus on narrative, The Last of Us adopted a linear level structure that ensures players will not deviate from the story Naughty Dog wants to tell. Nonetheless, many levels were designed with exploration in mind; that is, there are numerous passages and rooms filled with goodies just waiting to be discovered. The undeniable compulsion to explore will make players genuinely feel like scavengers on a doomed planet and that is a true testament to the talents behind constructing such an immersive universe.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Challenging, yet rewarding combat</span>: Despite The Last of Us' linear story, players still have free reign when it comes to gameplay. Sneaking past a mob of enemy is just as viable a tactic as picking them off with a firearm. Additionally, a total of six items such as Molotovs and medkits can be crafted with materials found whilst exploring. The catch is that many will require the same resources, making the choice between an offensive or defensive gadget rarely an easy one, especially when you can only afford one. It is the looming fear of getting caught or depleting your already limited arsenal that makes combat in The Last of Us so memorable and gripping.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Intense multiplayer</span>: Naughty Dogs found their riveting combat system such a success that they built an entire multiplayer component around it. All the staples from single player is still there; the sneaking, resource gathering, crafting, etc... Matches take place between two teams of four with each trying to whither down the other's stock of 24 lives. With such small teams confined within relatively large maps, combat is not commonplace and that makes every infrequent encounter potentially game-changing. Luck aside, staying together, reviving one another, and constant communication are pivotal to winning. The multiplayer here is just as much a cooperative mode as it is competitive.

<h1 style="color:red;">The Bad:</h1>

<span style="color:yellow;">Misplaced enemies</span>: There seems to be a lot of thought put into giving players various ways to deal with enemies, whether it is engaging them in an all-out gunfight, silently pacifying hostiles one by one, or even sneaking through an entire level without taking a single life. However, this consistency is broken halfway through the game, with the introduction of a new breed of enemy. These infected types run around almost at random, making it near impossible to sneak past them, let alone execute them quietly. If this was an attempt at forcing players to diversify their tactics, it was a poor one that compromised the quality of several combat segments.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Inconsistent AI</span>: The Last of Us excels in immersing its players in its deep combat system, detailed environments, and wonderfully characterized cast. While the game tries its best to make its universe as convincing as possible, wonky AI behavior shatters this illusion completely. Whether enemies will react to you hiding behind cover seems completely random and their unconcern after finding a corpse is extremely jarring. Friendly AI fairs better, but is still not without its flaws. Allies might stumble into traps and nonchalantly recover. Even more frequently, they will collide with enemies without reaction. To say this breaks immersion would be an understatement.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">A single, poorly designed level (minor spoilers)</span>: About halfway into the game, Joel and friends find themselves in a suburb, trying to get from one end of the street to the other. As one might expect, misfortune befalls them as a hostile sniper - with deadly accuracy, I might add<b> - </b>is perched in a building at the end of the road. It took me several tries before I finally found a vantage point from where I could blow my assailant's brains out, but to my surprise, the sniper rifle was not manned. It was automatically firing... not because of some brilliant contraption, but because the developers thought it would be an even better idea for the player to enter the sniper's nest and take him out through a series of unnecessary quick time events. Great...
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">A few nonsensical plot development (more minor spoilers)</span>: This bit is more nitpicking than anything else, but I felt it was worth mentioning as it breaks the flow of logic in an otherwise consistent narrative. As brilliant as the game's final moments were, I couldn't help but feel that they only existed because of one character's foolish decision. An entire bloodbath could have been avoided had that one individual not been so shortsighted. Plenty of other games rely on deus ex machina to advance their story, but I hold The Last of Us to higher standards. If irrational decisions made by fictional characters are the bane of your existence, the ending might not sit well with you.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Game versus player needs</span>: My final gripe is one extremely common and pervasive in numerous other, if not all, games, but it was most apparent in The Last of Us because I was so invested in its story and characters. When companions converse with Joel, you will frequently be faced with the tough decision to stay and listen or scour for precious resources at the expense of audibility.<b> </b>If you want to listen to what characters have to say with clarity, you'll have to walk alongside them. This is extremely problematic when the person you're following leads you into a completely new level thus sealing off the previous area without warning.
<br><br>
Make no mistake, The Last of Us is a game you MUST play if ever given the chance. It will not live up to all the hype in everyone's eyes, but the experience is unlike any other. The unforgettable setting and cast had me reading up on the game's lore long after I finished it. Even as I am preoccupied by other titles, the pick-up-and-play multiplayer will always be a good enough reason to revisit the decrepit world of The Last of Us every now and then. Naughty Dog has not just defined a generation, but it has also reminded everyone that games, like all other forms of media, can tell a mature and heartfelt story that is universally heralded as a masterpiece.
