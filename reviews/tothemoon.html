<h1 style="text-align:center">To The Moon (Review)</h1>

I personally believe that behind the development of every game, a war wages on between gameplay and storytelling. Improving one requires sacrifices at the other's expense and very rarely does a title succeed in both. Ken Gao, the visionary behind To the Moon, seemed quite aware of this as he worked on his first commercial debut. A heavy emphasis on plot and near complete neglect of gameplay has placed To the Moon at the center of an ongoing controversy: at what point does a visual novel become a game? With that said, it is important to manage your expectations before purchasing To the Moon because it may not be what you perceive a game should be.

To the Moon is the Inception video game that never came to be. Its story focuses on two doctors, Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, with very peculiar jobs: they construct artificial memories for those on their deathbed. In this first chapter of a planned series, the doctors find themselves hired by Johnny, an elderly man at the brink of death who wishes nothing more than to go to the moon. However, he cannot seem to recall why or what spurs his desires. To fulfill his dying wish, Rosalene and Watts must tap into Johnny's memory and visit key points of his life, attempting to unravel the origins of his desire so that their reconstruction feels authentic to Johnny's subconscious.
<br><br>
Unlike other games with strong narratives (Bioshock and Deus Ex, for those curious), To the Moon is not a social commentary. Its narrative focuses on something more personal: the death and mourning of a loved one. It is a tragic tale, and the player starts with already knowing how it end while still forced to witness the heart-wrenching moments that lead up to it. By the end of your 3-4 hour journey, I can almost guarantee that you will be at least emotionally moved, if not brought to tears.
<br><br>
At this point, Gao has already proven that he can successfully create an emotional bond with his audience through strong storytelling, but he still manages to one-up himself by self-composing one of the most memorable soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Each piece, driven by strong, melodic piano chords and backed with harmonious violins, finds a place in To the Moon, making moments big and small memorable, even when no dialogue is being exchanged.
<br><br>
Almost everything about To the Moon suggests it should be or have been adapted into a screenplay-and that is the crux of its problems. The game focuses so much on storytelling that it neglects to include any form of engaging gameplay elements. Sadly, this is reason enough for many to turn their backs on this unique gem of a game. Progress is made by interacting with several objects onscreen, reducing To the Moon to nothing more than a point-and-click adventure.
<br><br>
If you can endure a slow first hour and are looking for a game with a compelling narrative, I suggest you immediately purchase To the Moon. If to you, story should be second to gameplay, then it might be better to hold off. After all, To the Moon is not really a game; it is an experience.

Grade: 3/5
