<h1 style="text-align:center">I Am Alive (Review)</h1>

I Am Alive was once a survival horror game with big dreams and high hopes. When first conceived, it was purposed to be set in an explorable, expansive, post-apocalyptic world with deep gameplay mechanics focused on human interaction in times of crises. But two years after its ambitious beginnings, the original developers, Darkworks, handed the project off to Ubisoft Shanghai. In its new home, I Am Alive was rebuilt as an arcade title with many of its intended features either removed or condensed. So how does it fare in its current state?

I had not heard much about I Am Alive prior to release, but if its original narrative was anything like the final product, then the idea probably was not very good to begin with. The game takes place a year after America is struck by a massive earthquake known as "The Event." You play as an unnamed survivor, separated from and in search of his family-at least, that is how the story begins. The plot makes a sudden shift early in the game and becomes centered on the protagonist helping reunite someone else's family for the remainder of the campaign. By the time we reach the end credits, our protagonist's personal mission has made almost no progress. Some may find this hugely unsatisfying, though I suppose in some ways, it is poetic and fitting to such a morbid game.
<br><br>
While I Am Alive's narrative is devoid of creativity, its gameplay mechanics fortunately are not. Being aware of your surrounding is pivotal to survival. "The Event" has left much of America uninhabitable, filling the atmosphere with ash and dust, and to escape the hazardous environment, you must scale structures high enough to reach fresh air. This process eventually loses its novelty after the first few times, but it deters players from rushing and encourages exploration. But the most innovate idea I Am Alive offers is the idea to threaten and bluff. I say "idea" because its implementation is just deeply, deeply flawed. During confrontations, you may raise your pistol, loaded or not, to halt enemies in their tracks. At this point, the ability to negotiate would have been a hugely welcomed feature, but alas, the system never gets deeper. The moment you look away, your enemies will attack, rendering threats extremely useless since you are forced to kill regardless.
<br><br>
I Am Alive's single redeeming element is its atmosphere, which captures all the greatest facets of survival horror. The thick dust at ground level obscures vision beyond a few feet from your character. The element of surprise comes from not knowing who or what you will run into until it is too late. Ammo is extremely scarce, and your character is fragile, so knowing when to flee or fight becomes essential. Dying NPCs taking refuge throughout the city convey a genuine sense of desperation and futility. This is survival horror done right.
<br><br>
Atmosphere and missed ideas aside, nothing else about I Am Alive is very memorable. The graphics are bland, the soundtrack forgettable, and the animations clunky at best. There are side quests, but those are far and few in between. Remnants of Darkworks' original ideas are still apparent in the final product, but all of them marred by poor execution. I sincerely hope that Darkworks' vision will resurface one day, refined and in all its entirety. Until then, you should find your survival horror fix elsewhere.

Grade: 2/5
