<h1 style="text-align:center">Deadlight (Review)</h1>

The zombie craze has gone full swing in recent years, permeating into just about every form of media, most prominently in video games. In just the past year, we saw the releases of The Walking Dead, Resident Evil 6, ZombiU, Lollipop Chainsaw, etc. 2013 looks no different, with the recent release of The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct and the impending releases of Dead Island: Riptide, The Last of Us, and many, many more. The market is becoming saturated by games with similar themes which, by now, feel repetitive and uninspired. In this particular instance, if a developer is intent on making a game with zombies, the least one could ask for is for it to be unique. And if you are reading this recommendation, then you are probably wondering, "Does Deadlight have what it takes to stand out?"

Deadlight is an indie title developed by Tequila Works and published by Microsoft Studios. Amidst the sea of other zombie games, this one delivers the experience as a 2.5D platformer. In terms of gameplay, it is no different from a side-scroller-only here, the background adds another layer of visual depth. While the player is limited to moving in a two-dimensional plane, ambient objects will still appear three-dimensional. This illusion helps bring the atmosphere to life with backdrops that depict shuffling zombies and crumbling buildings.
<br><br>
Outside the action sequences are cutscenes rendered in sketches very reminiscent of comic books. Each character looks distinct, and even with the poor voice acting, these drawings do a fantastic job of conveying emotions. All this artistic investment immensely contributes to the dark and gloomy mood of the post-apocalyptic setting.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the great visuals are the only positive thing I have to say about Deadlight. Both its plot and its mechanics feel generic. The premise revolves around some protagonist, Randall Wayne, looking for his family in the aftermath of the outbreak. He, along with several companions, journey through the city and cross paths with beings they realize are more dangerous than the undead: other humans. The venture ultimately cumulates to a conclusion that is both nonsensical and laughable. Fortunately, there is an alternate ending that adds a neat little twist and puts a darker spin on the events of the game. However, unlocking this requires the player to beat Deadlight in one sitting and without deaths. How much stress this is worth is entirely up to you.
<br><br>
The crux of the problem, though, lies in its gameplay. There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but it lacks anything memorable. Deadlight encourages (and occasionally forces) the player to avoid confrontation despite presenting him with an arsenal of weapons. Doing so severely limits the freedom and variation in gameplay. With movement already confined to a two-dimensional plane, it might have been nice to at least give players both the options to act violently or to flee, not just the latter.
<br><br>
Another irritating issue I came across was jumping. Randall seems to lack the ability to jump in any direction other than straight up. Consequently, the player must be position Randall almost perfectly below a ledge if he is to grab onto it while jumping. This can be extremely rage-inducing when a horde of zombies is right on your heels.
<br><br>
I can see that Tequila Works tried to be different and on an artistic level, they were. Sadly, graphics are only a minor factor in the overall quality of a game. Deadlight is not a terrible game, but you shouldn't settle for average. There are other indie games that are more deserving of your time and money. But if you really insist on having zombies and platforming, then maybe, just maybe, Deadlight is for you.

Grade: 2/5
