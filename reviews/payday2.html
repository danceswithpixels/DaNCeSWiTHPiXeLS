<h1 style="text-align:center">Payday 2 (Review)</h1>

If you have ever wanted to rob a bank but were too afraid of the consequences, then Overkill Studio's heist simulator might just be the next best thing to let you enact your criminal fantasies. Payday 2 is one of two games under Overkill's brand, the first being its prequel, Payday: The Heist. The core gameplay of the original Payday amounted to nothing more than fighting army after army of law enforcement. With Payday 2, Overkill promised to make a game bigger and better in every way. If Payday 2 is a safe that we play to open, what can we expect to find within? Disappointment? Promises fulfilled? You decide.

Payday 2 foregoes any cohesive narrative and focuses primarily on its multiplayer roots. As of writing this review, there are 11 heists, all of which can be done in four varying difficulties: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, and Overkill. There is also a "Pro" mode for each difficulty which disables retries. Several of the heists are broken into multiple days with different objectives. For example, one heist will have you cook meth on the first day, trade it for intel on the second, and use that intel for an assassination on the third. Unfortunately, each heist must be played in its entirety for full payment, although players can change their loadout between days.

<h1 style="color:green;">The Good:</h1>

<span style="color:yellow;">Diverse maps</span>: One thing the first Payday lacked was diversity in its missions. Heists either had players escort a VIP or wait for a safe to be drilled open. While Payday 2 is not reluctant to reuse these objectives, it also is not afraid to experiment with more creative ideas. In addition to cracking safes, you will be transporting hefty bags of weaponry, assassinating targets, destroying property, and even cooking meth. With 11 unique heists at launch and more to come by way of downloadable content, Payday 2 will likely offer something to satisfy your criminal desires.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Open-endedness</span>: Payday 2 offers a multitude of ways to complete many missions. Safes and doors can be opened in various ways from the standard drilling to detonating C4s. If stealth is more your style, lockpicking, radar jammers, and silenced firearms will just be as effective. Objective locations also change with each playthrough. A vault that is located in the lobby of a bank might be on the second floor the next time you revisit that level. Some heists will even have multiple failed states. Failing to procure drugs for an exchange will not abruptly end the game, but will instead make the next phase more difficult.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Customization</span>: There are 13 primary weapons, 13 secondary weapons, 5 different gadgets, and 7 types of armor that become unlockable as you earn experience points from heists. All firearms have approximately a dozen attachable parts such as extended magazines, silencers, and scopes. Gadgets which include ammo bags, doctor bags, ECM jammers, sentry guns, and trip mines can also be upgraded for additional functionalities. While you can configure your arsenal in thousands of different ways, your most visible gear will be your mask. With over 40 templates that can be crafted using one of 40 color-changing materials, there are already well over a thousand combinations. Furthermore, masks can be imprinted with one of over 100 unique patterns using different color schemes from a selection of almost 90 varieties. With even the most minor details customizable, individualization is not a problem at all in Payday 2.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Diverse skill trees</span>: Heisters can be taught skills from four branches of specialties. Mastermind grants the ability to manipulate cops and hostages, Enforcer grants a variety of weapon bonuses, Technician equips the player with explosives, and Ghost reduces detection and enemy accuracy. Skill points can either be spent on one or two trainings or spread across all four. No class is essential to any one operation, but having a diverse team composition will no doubt expedite things. Every map is designed so that no class is ever useless, encouraging players to experiment with different builds until they find one that suits their play style.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Risk vs. reward</span>: One of the most exciting features of Payday 2 is its risk-versus-reward system. Heists will have more bags of illegal commodities than what is required of your team to steal. Whether or not you will take the extra bags of loot will depend on how greedy you or your teammates are. But of course, avarice will highly increase your chances of being gunned down by cops. Is an enormously greater payout worth risking twenty minutes of your hard work? This is the tough question you will be frequently asking yourself in Payday 2.

<h1 style="color:red;">The Bad:</h1>

<span style="color:yellow;">Choppy animations</span>: This quirk is not game-breaking, but does detract from the otherwise serious tone of Payday 2. When characters walk, especially while carrying bags of loot, their feet occasionally reset. Instead of interchanging legs, one will move and the other will just teleport to its default position. While it gives the character a "crippled" look (which I assume the developers intended), the animation is not smooth and looks rather ridiculous. The same could be said about the unnatural jumping animation in which characters bend their legs in funny angles whilst midair. Fortunately, none of this impacts gameplay.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Too easy</span>: My first two hours on Payday 2 were spent learning the ropes, playing through each heist on Normal difficulty to memorize all the different objectives. Once I grew tired of the lack of challenge, I escalated to Hard difficulty. Within another hour, I found myself playing exclusively on Very Hard. By the 10 hour mark, I felt well prepared to tackle Payday 2's toughest difficulty: Overkill. Reflecting back on the first Payday, I realized how much easier its successor is. Enemies are few and weak and the diverse arsenal at your disposal renders some levels too easy. Whereas Payday: The Heist had you wait for minutes while fending off waves of enemies until a safe is cracked, special gadgets in Payday 2 grants access in a matter of seconds and you will be out of there before security is any wiser.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Random loot drops</span>: I was not exaggerating when I said that Payday 2 has a high degree of customization, but before you feel overwhelmed by the seemingly limitless options, I hope you will enjoy grinding for your accessories because that is the only way to earn them. You not only have to buy gun or mask parts with your own heist money, but they must be unlocked beforehand. At the end of each full heist, each player gets to choose one of three cards that contains a random reward. With even the shortest missions lasting at least 10 minutes, you will probably die of old age long before you find your perfect loadout.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Unbalanced classes</span>: Every class has their place in Payday 2 and while none of them are bad, there are one or two that are far superior than the rest. The first that comes to mind is the Technician class which allows players to open safes in matters of seconds with C4s. This makes speeding through heists extremely easy, even in single player. As a matter of fact, C4s are so overpowered that only days after launch, players were kicked from lobbies for simply not having them. As long as there exists such an imbalance, there will always be elitists roaming around that will never play with "inferior" teammates.
<br><br>
<span style="color:yellow;">Lack of end-game content</span>: Once you have experienced all the heists Payday 2 has to offer, there really is not much else to do. Sure you can replay missions for more unlocks and level progression, but as I mentioned earlier, this can be a very tedious process. By the 15th hour, Payday 2 had lost much of the excitement and intrigue that kept me addicted for so long. Unless repetition is your cup of tea, the game's $30 entry fee can be better spent on other games with more content and longevity-but here's to hoping that the future DLCs will remedy this problem!
<br><br>
Before publishing this review, one of my biggest complaint was Payday 2's browser, which randomly generated heists and prohibited players from choosing the contracts he wanted to do. However, Overkill has since added the option to purchase contracts. The developers' receptiveness to community feedback alone should make them worthy of your support, but it also helps that Payday 2, retailing at $30, offers just as much entertainment and content as some $60, big-budget titles. With that said, it would almost be criminal to not give this game the chance it deserves.
