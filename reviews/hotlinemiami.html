<h1 style="text-align:center">Hotline Miami (Review)</h1>

Hotline Miami is notable for a number of things: its 80s-esque soundtrack and aesthetic, its violence, and its roots as an indie title made with the widely available development software GameMaker. This is not a game backed by an enormous budget, nor was it forged from the labor of numerous developers. It is, however, the lovechild of a very small but passionate studio, Dennaton Games. And as with many other indie games, it is important to harbor reasonable expectations before diving in.

Hotline Miami's gameplay is very reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto's earlier top-down days, wherein the action was viewed from a bird's eye perspective. The mechanics are simple, but extremely effective. The player-controlled character (who remains nameless through the duration of the game) possesses a very limited collection of actions, boiling down to only moving and attacking. Every button vital to gameplay is easily accessible, from discharging a weapon with a single right click to restarting an entire level with a tap of the "R" key. The ease with which everything can be controlled makes for a very fluid and fast-paced experience. Not even death can halt the player for more than a split second.
<br><br>
Graphically, Hotline Miami is not at all impressive, even when compared to other indie titles released years ago. However, the 8-bit aesthetics still work in the game's favor by reinforcing its homage to the 1980s. Do be wary that since Hotline Miami is so grounded in a specific time period, its atmosphere may not be to everyone's taste. The bright neon colors may be off-putting to some (myself included), and the soundtrack is unlike anything you would hear in a modern game (but whether or not that is a good thing is up to you). Soundtrack aside, Hotline Miami does make great use of its audio. The repeated thuds of beating down your enemies with a baseball bat is eerily soothing and hypnotic, and watching their pixelated blood splatter is even more so.
<br><br>
But for all the praise I can give to Hotline Miami, I still cannot wrap my mind around its plot. Its story follows an unnamed individual who is more or less a hitman taking orders from an answering machine. It is never fully explored why he does what he does so willingly, and unless you take the time to find all the hidden messages (or watch a video), you won't know the masterminds behind it all-and even when you do, it might still make very little sense. What I do admire is the dialogue. Unlike many other indie titles, the text here isn't remotely cringe inducing. The many ways the assassination contracts are relayed via answering machine are quite clever, even humorous at times.
<br><br>
Despite the visceral and violent nature of Hotline Miami, it does bear some "artistic" merit. Hotline Miami does a fantastic job of desensitizing the player and putting him in the shoes of a psychopath. The easily or deeply invested might find themselves discomforted after every level when the "protagonist" retraces his steps to the entrance, bearing witness to all the carnage he has wrought. The player will be doing so much slaughtering that, by the end of the game, it will be as natural as breathing.
<br><br>
My five hours spent on Hotline Miami certainly did not feel wasted, though I personally felt the incentives to replay the campaign (like unlocking achievements or equipment that give unique stat boosts) were not worth the grind. Nevertheless, Hotline Miami definitely stands out for its distinctive atmosphere and exhilarating gameplay. It is an exemplary title that shows the potential of a limited development software. Despite its lack of variety in gameplay, Hotline Miami excels in all aspects of its core mechanics.

Grade: 4/5
