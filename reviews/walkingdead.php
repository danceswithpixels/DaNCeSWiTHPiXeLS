<h1 style="text-align:center">The Walking Dead (Review)</h1>

Telltale Games have always been known for their above-average storytelling but lackluster gameplay. Their latest entry, The Walking Dead (based off the comic of the same name) is no exception. And like its predecessors, this title is split into five episodic installments, each running for 2-3 hours in length. But with such a stagnant and predictable formula, is The Walking Dead worth a purchase?

As a warning, all you zombie fanatics should be fully aware that the undead are NOT the focus of this game. The same can be said of the comics and the television series, but I digress. These monsters only serve as a backdrop for the real centerpiece - human behavior in a post-apocalyptic world. If you were expecting to gun down hordes of zombies, you WILL be disappointed, so read no further and go pick up a copy of Dead Island instead.
<br><br>
Like previous Telltale titles, the gameplay remains deeply rooted in the point-and-click adventures of yesteryear. Situational puzzles arise in the form of locked doors or supply hunting which requires the player to resolve by interacting with the environment. Some players, myself included, will find this tedious. Fortunately, the puzzles are not too difficult and can be solved with logical thinking and as much as I dreaded these moments, I understood their importance to the narrative's pacing. Each "dull" sequence made the next conflict much more impactful and that is a worthwhile tradeoff.
<br><br>
The plot is a page straight from any generic zombie flick in which everyone just wants to survive. Each of the five episodes will put the player in twisted scenarios, but it's how the events play out that really makes The Walking Dead shine. Characters, including the protagonist, will find themselves in morally ambiguous situations that will challenge the player's resolve. Would you kill someone who you SUSPECT is bitten? Who would you feed when there's not enough food for your camp? These are choices you make and rarely will they be simply black or white. It's these moments that make The Walking Dead so believable, but they're also why the game falters.
<br><br>
Players are frequently reminded that the game will change depending on the choices made. Having read the "alternate" outcomes, I can honestly say that this is not quite the case. Keeping track of divergent stories can be difficult and for this reason, each episode will funnel players back into the same situation, regardless of the route taken. For example, supporting characters all have an expiration date. If they are bound to die, they WILL die. Your decisions might delay their deaths, but they're still fated to meet a grisly end. Knowing this strips away most of the magic and wonderment, but perhaps Telltale's definition of consequences aren't the ones we've come to expect. It is the supporting characters' reaction to you that are ultimately being shaped and while the changes aren't grand, they're realistic.
<br><br>
There's a reason why The Walking Dead is declared as 2012's game of the year by so many. It is easily Telltale's most mature title and perhaps the most mature game I've ever played. It's made me feel sympathy and abhorrence. It's made me grimace and to my surprise, it's also made me cry. So kudos to Telltale for taking a risk by putting players in uneasy situations that no one else would dare to, for pushing the boundaries of immersion, and for showing that a great story will go a long way in making a game successful. While The Walking Dead may have its flaws, I predict that its undeniable influence and impact will still resonate for the years to come.

Grade: 4/5
